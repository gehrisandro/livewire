            // - find the tag
            // - look ahead for the next "<" character
            // - if we found a ">" character while looking ahead
            // - we know we are OUTSIDE a tag...
            //
            // There are two exceptions we have to account for:
            // 1) PHP has ->, =>, and ? > that we have make an exception for
            // 2) logical comparisons like "1 < 2" also have to be accounted for...
            //
            // We get around these exceptions by using a negative look behind for "?,=,-"
            // and ONLY matching "<" characters that have either "/" or a letter after them
